## observer

1. next(): This method is called when a new value is emitted from the data stream.
2. error(): This method is called when an error occurs in the data stream.
3. complete(): This method is called when the data stream ends.

example:

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";

@Component({
    selector: "my-app",
    templateUrl: "./app.component.html",
    styleUrls: ["./app.component.css"],
})
export class AppComponent {
    constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

    ngOnInit() {
        // Tạo một luồng dữ liệu từ yêu cầu HTTP
        const observable = this.http.get("https://example.com/data");

        // Đăng ký một observer để xử lý các giá trị được phát ra từ luồng dữ liệu
        observable.subscribe(
            (data) => {
                // Process new data
            },
            (error) => {
                // Error handling
            },
            () => {
                // The data stream ends
            }
        );
    }
